The database contains the data required for the JACC submission, the original code, and the application.
As I am a Chinese researcher, some file names and comments in the code contain Chinese. I have translated the file names into English for users to understand. For the comments, users are advised to translate them as needed. I will also upload the original Chinese-named files included in the code to ensure the code functions properly.
